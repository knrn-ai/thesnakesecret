# The Snake Secret

This is a birthday gift to my good friend Igor who's making an awesome chiptune music project [Yeltsin is Illuminati](https://yeltsinisilluminati.bandcamp.com/), and one of the albums is called [Gum Secret (Russian: Жвачный секрет)](https://yeltsinisilluminati.bandcamp.com/album/-). The snake character with the cat face is referencing the character from the album cover.

# Implementation

Made with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. All visuals and sound effects by me. BGM music by Yeltsin is Illuminati.

# Future improvements (planned)

- Add buttons: restart, volume & sound control
- Improve the page design, add more graphics
- Add a feature of increasing the snake's speed
- Add special events 
- Adaptive control and accelerometer support


# Special Thanks

This small game was my first ever experience trying make a game and also making something that big from scratch. I made it in July 2021 when I was heavily ill with acute tonsillitis for 28 days with COVID positive. I couldn't have done it without the support of my friends.

Thanks to Igor @tifgor for supporting me when I was heavily sick.

Thanks you @btshft for advice and helping me make the random fruit feature.

Thanks to Liza, Sasha, Pasha, Polina, and Marina for being the first testers, your feedback and supporting me.

❤️
